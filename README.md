## Tips
- Minimum EVM version requirement:
    - `Cancun` hardfork for `Transient Storage Opcodes`
- Minimum solidity version: 0.8.26
    - 0.8.26: Using custom errors with `require`
    - 0.8.24: Transient Storage Opcodes ([EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153)) [Blog post](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2024/01/26/transient-storage/)
- Build with `--via-ir` arg like: `forge build  --via-ir`
    - reason: 
        - `Using custom errors with require is only supported by the via IR pipeline, i.e. compilation via Yul`
